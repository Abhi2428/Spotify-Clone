Music Streaming Platform

Introduction

Music streaming platforms have transformed the way users access and listen to music. Traditional applications often struggle with scalability and maintenance, making it essential to adopt a microservices-based architecture. This project aims to develop a Spotify-like music streaming application using Spring Boot microservices, Eureka Server, and API Gateway, allowing users to browse, stream, and manage playlists efficiently.

Problem Statement

Monolithic music applications face challenges such as scalability issues, high server load, and lack of flexibility. A microservices approach enables independent services to manage different functionalities, such as:

User Authentication

Music Catalog

Playlists

Streaming

Payments

This ensures better performance, scalability, and maintainability.

Objectives

Design and develop a scalable and efficient music streaming application.

Implement Eureka Server for service discovery and API Gateway for request handling.

Enable users to browse, stream, and create playlists.

Support simultaneous streaming for multiple users.

Implement search and recommendation features based on user preferences.

Integrate subscription-based premium features using a payment system.

Scope of the Project

User Management: Secure authentication and profile management.

Music Catalog: A database of songs, albums, and artists.

Playlist Service: Users can create, modify, and delete playlists.

Streaming Service: Handles real-time music playback for multiple users.

Search & Recommendations: AI-driven song suggestions.

Payment Gateway: Monetization through premium subscriptions.

Technologies Used

Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Eureka, API Gateway)

Frontend: React.js / Angular

Database: MySQL (relational data), MongoDB (song metadata)

Messaging: Kafka / RabbitMQ (for async communication)

Storage: AWS S3 / Firebase (audio file storage)

Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes

Authentication: JWT-based authentication

Expected Outcome

A fully functional microservices-based music streaming platform.

Seamless concurrent streaming for multiple users.

Optimized search and recommendation system.

A scalable and maintainable microservices architecture.
