# Spotify-Clone
Spotfiy clone using SpringBoot 

1. #Introduction:
Music streaming platforms have transformed the way users access and listen to music.
Traditional applications often struggle with scalability and maintenance, making it essential to
adopt a microservices-based architecture. This project aims to develop a Spotify-like music
streaming application using Spring Boot microservices, Eureka Server, and API Gateway,
allowing users to browse, stream, and manage playlists efficiently.
2. Problem Statement
Monolithic music applications face challenges like scalability issues, high server load, and lack
of flexibility. A microservices approach allows independent services to manage different
functionalities such as User Authentication, Music Catalog, Playlists, Streaming, and
Payments, ensuring better performance and maintainability.
3. Objectives
• Design and develop a scalable and efficient music streaming application.
• Implement Eureka Server for Service Discovery and API Gateway for request
handling.
• Enable users to browse, stream, and create playlists.
• Allow multiple users to listen to the same song simultaneously.
• Implement search and recommendation features based on user preferences.
• Integrate subscription-based premium features using a payment system.
4. Scope of the Project
• User Management: Secure authentication and profile management.
• Music Catalog: A database of songs, albums, and artists.
• Playlist Service: Users can create, modify, and delete playlists.
• Streaming Service: Handles real-time music playback for multiple users.
• Search & Recommendations: AI-driven song suggestions.
• Payment Gateway: Monetization through premium subscriptions.
5. Technologies Used
• Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (Eureka, API Gateway)
• Frontend: React.js / Angular
• Database: MySQL (relational data), MongoDB (song metadata)
• Messaging: Kafka / RabbitMQ (for async communication)
• Storage: AWS S3 / Firebase (audio file storage)
• Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes
• Authentication: JWT-based authentication
6. Expected Outcome
• A fully functional microservices-based music streaming platform.
• Seamless concurrent streaming for multiple users.
• Optimized search and recommendation system.
• A scalable and maintainable microservices architecture.
